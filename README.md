# AAE

Implementation of Adversarial Auto-Encoder (AAE) in Pytorch. This implementation includes:

1. Basic unsupervised AAE.
2. Semi-supervised AAE, with specific coding of the latent space to a 'flower' of gaussians.

Also, a simple classifier (FC layer) is added for MNIST digits' classification.
